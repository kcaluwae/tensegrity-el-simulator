An implementation of the Tensegrity simulator in cartesian coordinates instead of the generalized coordinates used by Skelton.
This is more intuitive as the system is now a spring-mass net with a length constraint.
Ground contacts and constraints are not currently implemented (but it's easy to do so).
This directory contains an example of a minimal 6 bar structure (discussed in e.g. Calladine 1978).
